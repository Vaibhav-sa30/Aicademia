  <h1>Open Problems in Responsible AI</h1>
  <p>The field of Responsible AI (RAI) aims to ensure the development and use of AI in a way that is ethical, safe, and beneficial to society. However, several key challenges remain unsolved.</p>

  <h2>Examples of Open Problems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>**Fairness and Bias:**  AI systems can inherit and amplify biases from their training data. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes. Researchers are actively exploring techniques to debias data and algorithms.</li>
    <li>**Mitigating Malicious Use:** AI could be misused for malicious purposes like cyberattacks or social manipulation. Safeguards are needed to prevent this.</li>
    <li>**Interpretability:** Many AI systems are complex "black boxes" that are difficult to understand. This lack of transparency makes it hard to trust them and debug errors. Explainable AI (XAI) research seeks to address this.</li>
    <li>**Safety for Complex Systems:** As AI systems become more complex, robust safety measures are crucial to ensure they behave as intended and don't cause harm. This is challenging due to the potential for unforeseen emergent properties.</li>
    <li>**Aligning Goals with Values:** AI systems may have goals that conflict with human values. Methods are needed to ensure AI acts in accordance with human values.</li>
  </ul>
